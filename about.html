        <h2>What do you need to life off grid?</h2> 
        <p> <br> <BR>
        <h3>Land</h3> 
        Your land is the foundation of your off grid life. To go off grid, you need a parcel of land that lends itself to your new lifestyle choice. That will usually mean finding land in a remote area, far from strict building codes and permitting regulations.      
        <h3>Shelter</h3>
        The next thing you need is shelter. This is a fundamental need every human being requires to survive. Your off grid home can come in the form of a cabin, a traditional wood-frame home, a tiny house, a cob house, an Earthship, a strawbale home, or even a yurt, which is basically a large octagonal-shaped tent.
        <h3>Water and water collection system</h3>
        A good clean potable water source is vital for living off the grid. You will most likely not have access to city water or municipal county water sources on your land so you must choose a piece of land that either has a natural water source, or where it’s convenient to haul water.
        The other resource you need is a water collection system. This could be something as simple as rain barrel water catchment attached to your home’s gutter, or a more complex cistern water collection system that collects all the rainwater from your roof.
        <h3>Food</h3>
        Grow your own food! Since you most likely will not have everyday access to grocery stores and convenience stores to shop for food, you’ll benefit by growing your own in a garden and/or greenhouse.
        Ideally, it’s wise to have a traditional garden, some raised beds, and a greenhouse full of fruits and veggies. Meat and eggs can also be produced on your homestead if you have it set up for livestock. 
        <h3>Power Generation System</h3>
        Off grid power. This is where the actual off grid part comes in. Since you will not be connected to the power grid, you will need to be able to generate electricity yourself. This means having a power generating system with backups that can provide you with all the electricity you will need to run all your appliances, stove, refrigerator, washing machine, tv, computer, and charge your cell phone and other mobile devices.
        <h3>Power Storage</h3>
        So… You’re generating your own electricity during the day. That’s great. But when the sun goes down and the wind stops blowing, guess what? Unless you have a storage system, you won’t have electricity. So, if you plan on watching movies on Netflix or surfing the internet late at night, then you’re going to need a battery power storage system.
        <h3>Waste Disposal & Septic Tank</h3>
        No one likes talking about it, but it’s a fact of life. You’re going to have to deal with waste disposal. You’ll have to have some sort of composting waste disposal system, or you’ll dig a traditional septic system. Either way, you will have to follow local and federal guidelines on waste disposal.
        <h3>The Mindset to Live off the Grid</h3>
        Perhaps the most important thing you need to live off grid is the mindset and the will. It’s easy to talk about and say you’d love to live off the grid, free from the confines and drudgery of modern life. The idea of that kind of freedom can be enticing. It takes hard work though, and lots of it.
        Living sustainably takes a solid commitment, sharp focus, and motivation. The self-sufficient lifestyle is at the heart of independence and with that independence comes responsibility, not just for your lifestyle choice, but to your family and those depending on you.</p>
